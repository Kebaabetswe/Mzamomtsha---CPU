                <h1>A little history about our school</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Mzamomtsha started as a small school project for primarily learner's who stayed around Driftsands in Khayelitsha, but because every project can either grow or not. Ours grew ,the population grew and the children grew. So the school had to also grow. We decided to be a high school also to accommodate our learner's who were coming from our primary. We are still running and standing as we speak.

                <h1>Our Vision and Mission</h1>
                <pre>
                    Our vision at Mzamomtsha Primary School is to empower students to acquire, 
                    demonstrate, articulate and value knowledge and skills that will support 
                    them, as life-long learners, to participate in and contribute to the global 
                    world and practice the core values of the school: respect, tolerance & 
                    inclusion, and excellence.

                    Our mission is to develop students with active and creative minds, a sense of 
                    understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs. 
                    We stress the total development of each child: spiritual, moral, intellectual, 
                    social, emotional, and physical.
